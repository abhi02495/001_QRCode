### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
    <div class="bg-white h-auto w-80 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <div class="m-4 rounded-lg overflow-hidden"> <!-- overflow-hidden is required when rounding the images inside a container div to ensure that container box is rounded else 
      internal items won't look rounded-->
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qrcode_frontendMentor"/>
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-center px-4 py-2 font-outfit font-bold text-heading text-dark_blue leading-tight">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
      <p class="text-center px-8 py-4 font-outfit text-grayish_blue leading-tight text-default mb-2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
